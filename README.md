Not just another medicine reminder.

## Idea

The doctor will write digital prescriptions on our app which will automatically send out reminders for the patients to take their medicines. This will help the patient in 2 ways <br> 1. They won't have to get confused reading the incomprehensible writing of the doctor once they forget the medicines, their dosage, or timings <br> 2. There would be rare cases of forgetting to take a medicine on time.

USP: Patients don't have to manually enter date, time, and medicine name on their conventional reminder apps.
